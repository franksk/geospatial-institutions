# Geospatial Institutions
A compilation of geospatial colleges and universities in North America with a focus on Canada and the United States. 

Other colleges and universities outside of North America are welcome, too! The ultimate goal of this project is to include **_all_** geospatial programs available to students around the globe!

**_Check out the <a href="http://urisavc.github.io/geospatial-institutions" target="_blank">interactive map</a> and help make it a 'living map' with us!_**

## About the Project
Two lists originated as part of the URISA Vanguard Outreach Committee and we hope to reach out to a larger community to provide a list that will serve throughout the geospatial community! The two lists are:  

1. [URISA's Colleges and Universities](http://www.urisa.org/careers/colleges-and-universities), URISA website
2. [URISA Vanguard Cabinet Compiled List](http://bit.ly/urisavc_universities), Google spreadsheet

*__Pull requests welcome!__ We would like to keep this list updated with the latest information. If a new geospatial program has started, a contact has changed, or any other addition/change, please submit a pull request! New to Github? No worries, check out the guide below or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/urisavc" target="_blank">contact us</a> to get started. :-)*

## How to Add/Edit an Institution

1. **<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo" target="_blank">Fork</a> this project to your Guthub account**:   
If you don't have a Github account, definitely <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">get one</a>. We promise you won't regret it! Once you get one, or if you're already set up, fork this project. :-)

2. **Update the README.md file, if needed:**  
	• Retain the same overall structure seen in the file (*feel free to copy/paste and edit, where needed*). If you are unsure on how to do so, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/urisavc" target="_blank">contact us</a>. :-)  
	• Add in the location, listed in alphabetical order (ie: *US-Alabama*), if needed.  
	• If you know of any resources to the location under the header, please add them in for future reference (check out *US-Minnesota* for an example).  
	• Add the institution, listed in alphabetical order underneath the location title.   
  
3. **Add/edit the institution in the institutions.geojson file**:   
	• Add in the *name of the institution* and the *latitude and longitude*. We recommend <a href="http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html" target="_blank">this awesome site</a> for getting the latitude/longitude and going **_four_** decimal points deep and try and add in as much supporting information as you can/know.  
	• If the school offers a *program*, the marker-symbol should be set to *college* and *red*  (e.g. `"marker-symbol": "college", "marker-color": "#ef8a62"`) and if the school offers a *certificate*, the marker-symbol should be set to *library* and *blue* (e.g. `"marker-symbol": "library", "marker-color": "#5ab4ac"`).    
  
4. **Update the final numbers in the README.md**:  
For both the location (i.e. *US-Alabama (xx)*) and the overall number (i.e. *Full List (xx)*).

5. **Verify your edits**:  
Ensure the edits you made are accurate, both of the data you are entering and free of any typos. This makes things *much* easier down the road.

6. **Submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request" target="_blank">Pull Request</a> (PR)**:  
Need help? Here's a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request" target="_blank">Windows guide</a> on how to submit a request, or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/urisavc" target="_blank">contact us</a>!

7. **Pat yourself on the back for being all-around awesome :-P**
